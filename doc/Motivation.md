# Motivation
As a test automation engineer I hate to write synchronization and wait code, so I want to create quick and stable ui autotests.
I need a robust semantically laconic ui framework that save me a lot of time during ui web test automation.
I hate spend time in debug and adjust waiters. I want to write tests quick and easy.
